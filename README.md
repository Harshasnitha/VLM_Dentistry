🎯 Overview

This project revolutionizes dental patient communication by leveraging cutting-edge vision-language models to interpret dental images, detect abnormalities using standardized dental notation systems, and generate tailored, easy-to-understand patient education materials.

 🚀 Key Features
- **Multimodal AI Analysis**: Combines computer vision and natural language processing for comprehensive dental image interpretation
- **Personalized Patient Education**: Generates age-appropriate, culturally sensitive explanations tailored to individual patients
- **Dental Notation Integration**: Supports FDI, Universal, and Palmer notation systems
- **Real-time Communication**: Instant generation of patient-friendly explanations from clinical findings
- **Clinical Workflow Integration**: Seamless integration with existing dental practice management systems

 🏥 Problem Statement

Traditional dental communication relies heavily on technical jargon and verbal consultations that many patients struggle to understand. This communication gap leads to:
- Poor treatment adherence
- Increased patient anxiety
- Delayed treatments
- Reduced patient satisfaction

Our solution bridges this gap using advanced AI to transform complex dental findings into personalized, accessible educational content.

🔬 Research Question

*How can vision-language models be integrated into dental practice to improve patient communication, education, and treatment adherence by providing personalized, multimodal explanations of dental conditions and treatment plans while maintaining clinical accuracy and efficiency?*

```

 Running Inference
```python
from multimodal_dental import DentalVLM

# Initialize model
model = DentalVLM.from_pretrained("./models/dental_vlm")

# Generate patient explanation
image_path = "dental_xray.jpg"
patient_profile = {
    "age": 35,
    "education_level": "high_school",
    "language": "english",
    "anxiety_level": "moderate"
}

explanation = model.generate_explanation(
    image_path=image_path,
    patient_profile=patient_profile
)

print(explanation)
```

 Web Interface
```bash
# Start the backend server
python app/main.py
