Usage

Command Line Interface (CLI) Run predictions, training, validation, and exports directly from your terminal:

Predict with a pretrained YOLOv8n model

yolo predict model=yolov8n.pt For additional CLI examples, check the YOLO CLI Docs.

Python API

Embed YOLOv8 into your Python projects with the same flexibility as the CLI:

from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a pretrained YOLOv8n model
model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")

# Train on your dataset (e.g., coco8.yaml) for 50 epochs at 640px
model.train(data="coco8.yaml", epochs=50, imgsz=640, device="0")

# Validate on the validation split
model.val()

# Run inference on an image
results = model("path/to/image.jpg")
results[0].show()

# Export to ONNX
model.export(format="onnx")
