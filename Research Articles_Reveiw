Literature Review
The integration of Artificial Intelligence into dental caries diagnosis has transformed the field by enhancing both precision and operational efficiency through advanced machine learning and deep learning methodologies. Conventional diagnostic approaches, including manual visual-tactile assessments and radiographic evaluations, frequently face challenges in early-stage detection and suffer from subjective interpretation, resulting in inconsistent diagnostic outcomes (Selwitz et al., 2007). Machine learning technologies, especially Convolutional Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines, have demonstrated exceptional performance in dental image analysis, achieving cavity identification rates exceeding 90% accuracy (Yamashita et al., 2018). Advanced AI applications like AssistDent software and YOLO-based detection systems have enhanced real-time diagnostic capabilities, minimizing incorrect classifications and boosting overall diagnostic effectiveness (Ding et al., 2021). Nevertheless, significant barriers including patient data security, algorithmic bias, and healthcare provider adoption continue to impede broader implementation (Rischke et al., 2022). Emerging developments in distributed learning, remote dental care integration, and interpretable AI systems promise to advance AI-based diagnostics, enhancing their accessibility and reliability for dental practitioners.
Contemporary developments in AI-enhanced dental imaging have shown encouraging outcomes in advancing diagnostic precision and workflow efficiency. AbuSalim and colleagues (2024) presented a comprehensive multi-level methodology employing YOLO-based detection algorithms for enhanced tooth identification and categorization. Their research indicates that AI-enhanced imaging technologies can substantially improve diagnostic reliability while minimizing human error in clinical assessments. Additionally, Ram√≠rez-Pedraza and team (2025) investigated deep learning implementations in oral health maintenance, particularly emphasizing automated dental plaque identification through YOLO architecture. Their work demonstrates AI model capabilities in advancing preventive dental care through immediate plaque detection and measurement using standardized indices like O'Leary. These developments reflect an increasing movement toward AI adoption in dental practice, establishing foundations for innovative approaches that reduce patient discomfort while streamlining clinical operations.
The research conducted by AbuSalim and colleagues (2024) examines YOLO-based detection model applications in dental image processing, with particular emphasis on tooth identification and classification systems. This investigation addresses shortcomings in conventional dental imaging methods while assessing AI-powered solution effectiveness. The team examined whether YOLO-based detection technology could improve tooth classification precision beyond traditional approaches. Their research approach included YOLOv5 model training using clinical dental image datasets, implementing data preprocessing protocols, and assessing model effectiveness through established accuracy measurements including mean Average Precision. Results demonstrated that AI-powered detection methods substantially enhance diagnostic reliability, reducing typical manual assessment errors. The investigation showed YOLO model capabilities in accurately identifying multiple dental structures with exceptional precision, demonstrating potential for real-time AI-supported dental evaluation. However, the study acknowledged specific constraints, including limited dataset scope potentially affecting broad applicability, and reliance on superior image preprocessing for peak performance. This work advances the field by proving AI-enhanced dental diagnostic feasibility while highlighting dataset quality importance in model development. The research provides significant relevance to our current initiative, offering solid groundwork for implementing YOLO-based systems in dental imaging applications. Expanding upon these discoveries, our research will advance this work through YOLOv8 implementation, integrating more comprehensive datasets, and improving detection precision and efficiency for real-world clinical use.
Salahin and colleagues' (2023) investigation centers on utilizing mobile device photography for dental cavity identification. Their approach employs YOLOv5 architecture for object detection due to its speed and precision characteristics. The system generates feature representations across three scales to identify small, medium, and large dental abnormalities within images. Performance evaluation utilizes mean average precision metrics through analysis of correct and incorrect detection rates. Findings demonstrate YOLOv5 effectiveness in identifying medium and large dental caries while showing reduced accuracy for smaller lesions. This work establishes mobile imaging as a practical and economical cavity screening approach.
Our project focuses on developing and deploying an AI-enhanced imaging platform to revolutionize dental diagnostic procedures. Primary goals include improving diagnostic precision through machine learning-powered detection algorithms that enhance early cavity identification while reducing diagnostic oversights. The initiative aims to decrease healthcare costs by offering economical alternatives to conventional radiographic methods, reducing requirements for expensive imaging infrastructure and associated expenses. The project emphasizes improving patient satisfaction by providing non-invasive, comfortable examination alternatives, particularly beneficial for individuals experiencing dental anxiety. Furthermore, it promotes responsible and safe healthcare practices by minimizing radiation-dependent diagnostic methods and reducing patient discomfort through sophisticated imaging technologies. Finally, the system streamlines dental practice management by reducing extensive sterilization equipment requirements, improving operational efficiency and decreasing facility overhead expenses.
